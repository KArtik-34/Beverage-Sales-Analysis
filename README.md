**📊 Beverage Sales Analysis & Predictive Modeling**

**📌 Project Overview**
This project analyzes beverage sales data (2021-2023) using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in sales, discounts, pricing, and category performance. The insights will guide predictive modeling for forecasting and decision-making.

**🔍 Key Analyses**
✔ Region-wise Sales: Identifying top-performing regions and their best-selling products.
✔ Discount Impact: Understanding how discounts influence B2B sales.
✔ Price Sensitivity: Analyzing the effect of unit price on total sales.
✔ Category Performance: Finding the most popular product categories.
✔ Yearly & Quarterly Trends: Comparing sales across 2021, 2022, and 2023.

**🚀 Next Steps – Predictive Modeling**
We will develop models to forecast future sales and optimize pricing strategies.
